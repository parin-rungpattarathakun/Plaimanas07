Plaimanas07


About
Plaimanas07 is an open-source Thai typeface designed by Parin Rungpattaratkhun, in collaboration with Cadson Demak.  
This project began as a personal exploration into Thai letterform aesthetics, particularly focusing on how traditional calligraphy could inform a modern digital font.

While many Thai typefaces prioritize legibility or system utility, Plaimanas07 seeks to fill a different gap â€” the lack of Thai fonts with artistic elegance.  
The design is rooted in Thai calligraphy but redrawn with a contemporary eye, balancing emotion with precision.

This typeface is offered as a gift to the design community, with the hope that more designers will be inspired to create and elevate Thai script.

**Note:** All drawings are original. This is not a modification of an existing Thai typeface.
